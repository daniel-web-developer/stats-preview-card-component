## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this project, I've learned how to use two new CSS properties, one I used to make the image purple (background-blend-mode) and, the other, I used to add a custom spacing between lines (line-height).

### Continued development

I couldn't get the image color intended according to the original idea, so I'd like to learn how to do it properly, and I'd like to make the sizes the way the designer intended, but that's just too hard without the files only accessible to premium users.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - CSS property background-blend-mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-blend-mode) - Used in order to change the color of the image
- [MDN Web Docs - CSS property line-height](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/line-height) - Used in order to set a custom line spacing.
